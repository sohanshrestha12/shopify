# Shopify Storefront API Product Fetching

This project demonstrates how to fetch store data from Shopify's Storefront API in a paginated form. The Shopify store contains products, and the solution retrieves all these products in batches of 10 per API call. The frontend is built with **React** to display the fetched products.

## Features

- **Fetch Products from Shopify Storefront API**: The application fetches products from a Shopify store using the Storefront API, with pagination to retrieve products in batches.
- **Display Products**: The fetched products are displayed on a webpage, with each page showing 10 products, and navigation to the next and previous pages is available.
